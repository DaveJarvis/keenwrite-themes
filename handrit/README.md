# Handrit

A theme suitable for exporting manuscripts. Aspects of this theme include:

* Double-spaced lines
* Courier font (TeX Gyre Cursor)
* Plain hyperlinks
* Single hash for scene separators
* Author, title, and page number in upper-right corner
* Formatted document word count
* Page margins set to one inch
* Basic typography settings (no smart em-dashes, ellipses, etc.)
* The word "END" is centered after the last paragraph

Thanks to William Shunn for reviewing the formatting.
